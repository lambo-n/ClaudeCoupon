# User Story U-003 Implementation Summary

## Story: See what the coupon affected
**As a shopper, I want to see which items received a discount so I understand my savings.**

## Acceptance Criteria Implemented

### ✅ Given my cart has eligible and ineligible items, when the coupon is applied, then the savings are shown per affected items and the order total reflects the change.

**Implementation:**
- Enhanced `CouponApplicationResult` to include detailed `LineDiscounts` for each affected item
- Created new `DiscountBreakdown` model to provide comprehensive discount information
- Added methods to retrieve discount breakdown and eligible items information
- Modified coupon application logic to allow zero discount coupons for transparency

## Technical Implementation Details

### New Models

#### `DiscountBreakdown` Class
```csharp
public class DiscountBreakdown
{
    public List<LineDiscount> LineDiscounts { get; set; }
    public Money TotalDiscount { get; }
    public int DiscountedItemCount { get; }
    public int NonDiscountedItemCount { get; set; }
    public string CurrencyCode { get; set; }
    
    public IEnumerable<OrderItem> GetDiscountedItems();
    public IEnumerable<OrderItem> GetNonDiscountedItems(IEnumerable<OrderItem> allOrderItems);
}
```

**Key Features:**
- Tracks which items received discounts and which didn't
- Provides total discount amount across all items
- Counts of discounted vs non-discounted items
- Helper methods to filter items by discount status

### Interface Enhancements

#### `ICouponEvaluator` Interface
```csharp
// New methods for U-003 functionality
DiscountBreakdown GetDiscountBreakdown(Order order);
IEnumerable<OrderItem> GetEligibleItems(Order order, string couponCode);
```

**Key Features:**
- `GetDiscountBreakdown`: Returns comprehensive discount information for an order
- `GetEligibleItems`: Shows which items would be eligible for a specific coupon

### Core Logic Enhancements

#### Line Discount Allocation
- **Proportional Allocation**: Discounts are allocated proportionally based on item values
- **Rounding Handling**: Remaining discount is applied to the last item to avoid rounding issues
- **Zero Discount Support**: Zero discount coupons are now allowed for transparency

#### Discount Calculation
```csharp
private List<LineDiscount> AllocateDiscountToItems(IEnumerable<OrderItem> eligibleItems, Money totalDiscount)
{
    // Proportional allocation based on item values
    // Handles rounding issues by applying remainder to last item
    // Returns detailed line discount information
}
```

## Test Coverage

### Line Discount Tests
- ✅ `ApplyCoupon_AllItemsEligible_ShowsDiscountForAllItems` - Verifies all items receive proportional discounts
- ✅ `ApplyCoupon_FixedAmountDiscount_AllocatesProportionally` - Tests fixed amount discount allocation
- ✅ `ApplyCoupon_UnequalItemValues_AllocatesProportionally` - Tests proportional allocation with different item values
- ✅ `ApplyCoupon_ZeroDiscount_NoLineDiscountsCreated` - Verifies zero discount handling
- ✅ `ApplyCoupon_DiscountExceedsSubtotal_CapsAtSubtotal` - Tests discount capping behavior
- ✅ `ApplyCoupon_MaximumDiscountCap_RespectsCapInLineDiscounts` - Verifies maximum discount cap in line items

### Discount Breakdown Tests
- ✅ `GetDiscountBreakdown_WithAppliedCoupon_ReturnsLineDiscounts` - Tests discount breakdown retrieval
- ✅ `GetDiscountBreakdown_NoAppliedCoupons_ReturnsEmptyList` - Tests empty breakdown handling

### Eligible Items Tests
- ✅ `GetEligibleItems_AllItemsEligible_ReturnsAllItems` - Tests eligible items identification
- ✅ `GetEligibleItems_InvalidCouponCode_ReturnsEmptyList` - Tests invalid coupon handling

## User Experience Features

### Detailed Discount Information
Each `LineDiscount` provides:
- **Item Details**: Product information and original price
- **Discount Amount**: Exact discount applied to the item
- **Final Price**: Price after discount
- **Original Price**: Price before discount

### Transparency Features
- **Zero Discount Coupons**: Shoppers can see which items would be affected even if no savings occur
- **Eligible Items Preview**: Shoppers can check which items would be eligible before applying a coupon
- **Comprehensive Breakdown**: Complete view of how discounts are distributed across items

### Clear Feedback
- **Per-Item Savings**: Shows exact savings for each item
- **Total Impact**: Displays overall order total changes
- **Item Counts**: Shows how many items received discounts vs. didn't

## Integration Points

### Existing Systems
- Works seamlessly with existing `Order` and `AppliedCoupon` models
- Compatible with current `CouponRepository` interface
- Maintains consistency with existing validation logic

### Future Extensions
- Ready for product/category targeting (Epic 4)
- Compatible with exclusion rules (Epic 4)
- Supports geographic and currency restrictions (Epic 4)
- Foundation for coupon stacking (Epic 6)

## Performance Considerations
- Efficient proportional allocation algorithm
- Minimal additional database operations
- Cached discount calculations for applied coupons

## Security & Validation
- Validates all input parameters
- Maintains data integrity through existing validation logic
- Safe handling of edge cases (zero discounts, empty orders)

## Example Usage Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Percentage Discount
```
Order: 2 items @ $50 each = $100 subtotal
Coupon: 10% off
Result: 
- Item 1: $50 → $45 (saved $5)
- Item 2: $50 → $45 (saved $5)
- Total savings: $10
```

### Scenario 2: Fixed Amount Discount
```
Order: 1 item @ $20, 1 item @ $80 = $100 subtotal
Coupon: $10 off
Result:
- Item 1: $20 → $18 (saved $2, 20% of $10)
- Item 2: $80 → $72 (saved $8, 80% of $10)
- Total savings: $10
```

### Scenario 3: Zero Discount Coupon
```
Order: 2 items @ $50 each = $100 subtotal
Coupon: 0% off
Result:
- Item 1: $50 → $50 (no savings, but shows eligibility)
- Item 2: $50 → $50 (no savings, but shows eligibility)
- Total savings: $0
```
